# The CU Exchange
**Inspiration**

As Cambridge students, we wanted to gamify the studying experience. CUEx encourages students to explore libraries and spend time studying in them. While our concept is based off of libraries, this can be extended to other locations such as formal halls, BOPs, events, and cafes.

**What it does**

We track the students' time and delegate a proportion of the shares of the library base off of how long the student spends in the library. The student can then redeem these for IRL items.
